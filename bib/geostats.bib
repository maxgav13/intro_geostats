  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a Ward-like hierarchical clustering algorithm including spatial/geographical constraints. Two dissimilarity matrices ùê∑0D0D\_0 and ùê∑1D1D\_1 are inputted, along with a mixing parameter ùõº‚àà[0,1]Œ±‚àà[0,1]\textbackslash alpha \textbackslash in [0,1]. The dissimilarities can be non-Euclidean and the weights of the observations can be non-uniform. The first matrix gives the dissimilarities in the ‚Äúfeature space‚Äù and the second matrix gives the dissimilarities in the ‚Äúconstraint space‚Äù. The criterion minimized at each stage is a convex combination of the homogeneity criterion calculated with ùê∑0D0D\_0 and the homogeneity criterion calculated with ùê∑1D1D\_1. The idea is then to determine a value of ùõºŒ±\textbackslash alpha which increases the spatial contiguity without deteriorating too much the quality of the solution based on the variables of interest i.e. those of the feature space. This procedure is illustrated on a real dataset using the R package ClustGeo.},

This study was conducted in an area in the southern part of the Arkansas River Basin in Colorado. Six LANDSAT images acquired during the years: 2000, 2001, 2003, 2004, 2005, and 2006 in conjunction with field data were used to estimate soil salinity in the study area. The optimal subsets of band combinations from the LANDSAT images that correlate best with the soil salinity data sets were selected. Ordinary kriging, regression kriging, and cokriging were applied to 2,914 soil salinity data points collected in alfalfa, cantaloupe, corn, and wheat fields in conjunction with the selected LANDSAT image band combination subsets. Ordinary least-squares ÕëOLSsÕí were used to regress the correlated band combinations to generate a soil salinity surface. The residuals of the OLS multiple regression model were kriged and combined with the soil salinity surface generated using the OLS multiple regression model to produce the final soil salinity surface of the regression kriging model. The same LANDSAT band combinations used with the regression kriging technique were used as secondary data variables with the cokriging technique, while the soil salinity data was used as a primary variable. The results show that the best band combinations for estimating soil salinity with different crops are as follows: alfalfa Õìred, near infrared, and normalized difference vegetation index ÕëNDVIÕîÕí; cantaloupe Õëblue and greenÕí; corn Õënear, thermal, and NDVIÕí; and wheat Õëblue and thermalÕí. The performance of the different geostatistical models used in this study is: Õë1Õí ordinary kriging; Õë2Õí regression kriging; and Õë3Õí cokriging. Estimation of soil salinity works best for corn, then wheat, cantaloupe, and alfalfa.},

  abstract = {The choice of an optimal interpolation technique for estimating soil properties at unsampled locations is an important issue in sitespecific management. The objective of this study was to evaluate inverse distance (InvD) weighting, ordinary kriging (KO), and lognormal ordinary kriging (KOlog) to determine the optimal interpolation method for mapping soil properties. Relationships between statistical properties of the data and performance of the methods were analyzed using soil test P and K data from 30 agricultural fields. For InvD weighting, we used powers of 1, 2, 3, and 4. The numbers of the closest neighboring points ranged from 5 to 30 for the three methods. The results suggest that KOlog can improve estimation precision compared with KO for lognormally distributed data. The criteria helpful in deciding whether KOlog is applicable for the given data set were the Kolmogorov‚ÄìSmirnov goodness-of-fit statistic, coefficient of variation, skewness, kurtosis, and the size of the data set. Careful choice of the exponent value for InvD weighting and of the number of the closest neighbors for both InvD weighting and kriging (KO or KOlog) significantly improved the estimation accuracy (P ’Ö 0.05). However, no a priori decision could be made about the optimal exponent and the number of the closest neighbors based on the statistical properties of the data. For the majority of the data sets, kriging with the optimal number of the neighboring points, a carefully selected variogram model, and appropriate log-transformation of the data performed better than InvD weighting. Correlation coefficients between experimental data and estimated results of kriging were higher than those of InvD for 57 out of a total of 60 data sets, kriging mean absolute errors were lower for 44 data sets, and kriging mean errors were lower than those of InvD weighting for 31 data sets.},

The LMM framework has also allowed the development of models in which the spatial covariance need not be assumed to be stationary. Such models are generally more plausible than stationary ones from a pedological perspective, and when applied to soil data they have been found to give prediction error variances that better describe the uncertainty of predictions at validation sites. Finally consideration is given to how scientific understanding of variable processes in the soil might be used to infer the likely statistical form of the observed soil variation.},

  abstract = {Many environmental scientists are analysing spatial data by geostatistical methods and interpolating from sparse sample data by kriging to make maps. They recognize its merits in providing unbiased estimates with minimum variance. Several statistical packages now have the facilities they require, as do some geographic information systems. In the latter kriging is an option for interpolation that can be done at the press of a few buttons. Unfortunately, the ease conferred by this allows one to krige without understanding and to produce unreliable and even misleading results. Crucial for sound kriging is a plausible function for the spatial covariances or, more widely, of the variogram. The variogram must be estimated reliably and then modelled with valid mathematical functions. This requires an understanding of the assumptions in the underlying theory of random processes on which geostatistics is based. Here we guide readers through computing the sample variogram and modelling it by weighted least-squares fitting. We explain how to choose the most suitable functions by a combination of graphics and statistical diagnostics. Ordinary kriging follows straightforwardly from the model, but small changes in the model function and its parameters can affect the kriging error variances. When kriging is automated these effects remain unknown. We explain the choices to be made when kriging, i.e. whether the support is at points or over blocks, and whether the predictions are global or within moving windows.},

  abstract = {Estimation of some mineral deposits involves chemical species or a granulometric mass balance that constitute a closed constant sum (e.g., 100\%). Data that add up to a constant are known as compositional data (CODA). Classical geostatistical estimation methods (e.g., kriging) are not satisfactory when CODA are used, since bias is expected when estimated mean block values are back-transformed to the original space. CODA methods use nonlinear transformations, and when the transformed data are interpolated, they cannot be returned directly to the space of the original data. If these averages are back-transformed using the inverse function, bias is generated. To avoid this bias, this article proposes geostatistical simulation of the isometric logratio ratio (ilr) transformations back-transforming point simulated values (instead of block estimations), with the averaging being postponed to the end of the process. The results show that, in addition to maintaining the mass balance and the correlations among the variables, the means (E-types) of the simulations satisfactorily reproduce the statistical characteristics of the grades without any sort of bias. A complete case study of a major bauxite deposit illustrates the methodology.},

  abstract = {The particularities of geosystems and geoscience data must be understood before any development or implementation of statistical learning algorithms. Without such knowledge, the predictions and inferences may not be accurate and physically consistent. Accuracy, transparency and interpretability, credibility, and physical realism are minimum criteria for statistical learning algorithms when applied to the geosciences. This study briefly reviews several characteristics of geoscience data and challenges for novel statistical learning algorithms. A novel spatial spectral clustering approach is introduced to illustrate how statistical learners can be adapted for modelling geoscience data. The spatial awareness and physical realism of the spectral clustering are improved by utilising a dissimilarity matrix based on nonparametric higher-order spatial statistics. The proposed model-free technique can identify meaningful spatial clusters (i.e. meaningful geographical subregions) from multivariate spatial data at different scales without the need to define a model of co-dependence. Several mixed (e.g. continuous and categorical) variables can be used as inputs to the proposed clustering technique. The proposed technique is illustrated using synthetic and real mining datasets. The results of the case studies confirm the usefulness of the proposed method for modelling spatial data.},

Such data sets occur most often in mining, hydrogeochemistry and soil science, but the results gathered here are relevant for any regionalised compositional data set. The paper covers the basic definitions, the analysis of the spatial codependence between components, mapping methods of cokriging and cosimulation honoring compositional constraints, the role of pre- and post-transformations such as log-ratios or multivariate normal score transforms, and block-support upscaling. The main result is that multivariate geostatistical techniques can and should be performed on log-ratio scores, in which case the system data-variograms-cokriging/cosimulation is intrinsically consistent, delivering the same results regardless of which log-ratio transformation was used to represent them. Proofs of all statements are included in an appendix.},

  abstract = {The present research study investigates the application of nonlinear normalizing data transformations in conjunction with ordinary kriging (OK) for the accurate prediction of groundwater level spatial variability in a sparsely-gauged basin. We investigate three established normalizing methods, Gaussian anamorphosis, transGaussian kriging and the Box-Cox method to improve the estimation accuracy. The first two are applied for the first time to groundwater level data. All three methods improve the mean absolute prediction error compared to the application of OK to the non-transformed data. In addition, a modified Box-Cox transformation is proposed and applied to normalize the hydraulic heads. The modified Box-Cox transformation in conjunction with OK is found to be the optimal spatial model based on leave-one-out cross-validation. The recently established Spartan semivariogram family provides the optimal model fit to the transformed data. Finally, we present maps of the groundwater level and the kriging variance based on the optimal spatial model.},

  abstract = {Soil erosion is widely predicted as a function of six input factors, including rainfall erosivity, soil erodibility, slope length, slope steepness, cover management, and support practice. Because of the multiple factors, their interactions, and their spatial and temporal variability, accurately mapping the factors and further soil loss is very difficult. This paper compares two geostatistical methods and a traditional stratification to map the factors and to estimate soil loss. Soil loss is estimated by integrating a sample ground data set, TM images, and a slope map. The geostatistical methods include collocated cokriging and a joint sequential co-simulation model. With both geostatistical methods, local estimates and variances at any location where the factors and soil loss are unknown can be computed. The results showed that the two geostatistical methods performed significantly better than traditional stratification in terms of overall and spatially explicit estimates. Furthermore, the cokriging led to higher accuracy of mean estimates than did the co-simulation, while the latter provided decision makers with reliable uncertainties of the local estimates as useful information to assess risk when making decisions based on the prediction maps.},

  abstract = {Near surface air temperature (NSAT) is a primary descriptor of terrestrial environmental conditions. In recent decades, many efforts have been made to develop various methods for obtaining spatially continuous NSAT from gauge or station observations. This study compared three spatial interpolation (i.e., Kriging, Spline, and Inversion Distance Weighting (IDW)) and two regression analysis (i.e., Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR)) models for predicting monthly minimum, mean, and maximum NSAT in China, a domain with a large area, complex topography, and highly variable station density. This was conducted for a period of 12 months of 2010. The accuracy of the GWR model is better than the MLR model with an improvement of about 3 ‚ó¶C in the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), which indicates that the GWR model is more suitable for predicting monthly NSAT than the MLR model over a large scale. For three spatial interpolation models, the RMSEs of the predicted monthly NSAT are greater in the warmer months, and the mean RMSEs of the predicted monthly mean NSAT for 12 months in 2010 are 1.56 ‚ó¶C for the Kriging model, 1.74 ‚ó¶C for the IDW model, and 2.39 ‚ó¶C for the Spline model, respectively. The GWR model is better than the Kriging model in the warmer months, while the Kriging model is superior to the GWR model in the colder months. The total precision of the GWR model is slightly higher than the Kriging model. The assessment result indicated that the higher standard deviation and the lower mean of NSAT from sample data would be associated with a better performance of predicting monthly NSAT using spatial interpolation models.},

  abstract = {Many spatial interpolation methods perform well for gentle terrains when producing spatially continuous surfaces based on ground point data. However, few interpolation methods perform satisfactorily for complex terrains. Our objective in the present study was to analyze the suitability of several popular interpolation methods for complex terrains and propose an optimal method. A data set of 153 soil water profiles (1 m) from the semiarid hilly gully Loess Plateau of China was used, generated under a wide range of land use types, vegetation types and topographic positions. Four spatial interpolation methods, including ordinary kriging, inverse distance weighting, linear regression and regression kriging were used for modeling, randomly partitioning the data set into 2/3 for model fit and 1/3 for independent testing. The performance of each method was assessed quantitatively in terms of mean-absolute-percentage-error, root-mean-square-error, and goodness-of-prediction statistic. The results showed that the prediction accuracy differed significantly between each method in complex terrain. The ordinary kriging and inverse distance weighted methods performed poorly due to the poor spatial autocorrelation of soil moisture at small catchment scale with complex terrain, where the environmental impact factors were discontinuous in space. The linear regression model was much more suitable to the complex terrain than the former two distance-based methods, but the predicted soil moisture changed too sharply near the boundary of the land use types and junction of the sunny (southern) and shady (northern) slopes, which was inconsistent with reality because soil moisture should change gradually in short distance due to its mobility in soil. The most optimal interpolation method in this study for the complex terrain was the hybrid regression kriging, which produced a detailed, reasonable prediction map with better accuracy and prediction effectiveness.},
